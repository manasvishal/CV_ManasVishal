\textbf{\uline{Profile:}} Ph.D. student in Computational Sciences
at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth. Broadly interested in
General Relativity and High Performance Computing. Currently working
as a Distinguished Doctoral Fellow in the Engineering and Applied
Sciences program with a focus on modeling gravitational waves from
extreme mass ratio black hole binaries using advanced numerical and
mathematical techniques.\vspace{0.5cm}

\textcolor{cyan}{2021 - current }\textbf{\textcolor{blue}{(Ph.D. project)}} & \textbf{\textcolor{blue}{EMRI modeling with spinning primary Black
Hole using discontinuous Galerkin method}}\textbf{}\linebreak{}
\textbf{\small{}Dr. Scott Field and Dr. Gaurav Khanna, UMass Dartmouth}\linebreak{}
It is need of the hour to have a gravitational wave template bank
for upcoming detectors. This project deals with one of the primary
sources of the upcoming space borne detector LISA which are extreme
mass ratio black hole binaries. I have written a very accurate Teukolsky
solver code using discontinuous Galerkin method to model the waveform
from EMRI system with a spinning primary.\linebreak{}

\textcolor{cyan}{June 27, 2020 - June 2021 }\textbf{\textcolor{blue}{(MS
project)}} & \noindent \textbf{\textcolor{blue}{Massless Scalar Waves in AdS Spacetime}}\textbf{
}\linebreak{}
\textbf{\small{}Dr. Rajesh Nayak, IISER Kolkata}\linebreak{}
It has been shown in recent works that the non-asymptotic AdS spacetime
eventually loses the curvature due to the formation of a black hole.
The boundary conditions for this system are complicated, and hence
very little work has been done on this topic computationally. I intend
to explore the stability of the AdS spacetime when perturbed by gravitational
waves. I am using the scalar perturbations to study the solution of
the massless scalar wave equation in this geometry. I have started
working on 4-dimensional spacetimes, but it can be extended to N-dimensions.\linebreak{}
\tabularnewline
\textcolor{cyan}{Aug. 2020 - Dec. 2020} & \textbf{\textcolor{blue}{Independent study on Magnetohydrodynamics
(MHD) and Fluid Dynamics}}\textbf{ }\linebreak{}
\textbf{\small{}Dr. Dibyendu Nandi, IISER Kolkata}\linebreak{}
The motivation for this independent study comes from General Relativistic
Magnetohydrodynamic simulation of Neutron Stars. I aim to teach myself
the concepts of Advection Equation and different types of flows in
fluid systems. I am acquiring skills in MHD simulations so that I
could learn the techniques of General Relativistic version of it.

\tabularnewline
\textcolor{cyan}{Dec. 2019 - March 2020} & \textbf{\textcolor{blue}{Finesse (Frequency domain INterfErometer
Simulation SoftwarE) Workshop and Hackathon}}\textbf{}\linebreak{}
\textbf{\small{}IUCAA Pune}\linebreak{}
Finesse is a sophisticated simulation package for modeling optics
and laser interferometers. This interferometer modeling software was
developed for the design of gravitational wave detectors, but is easy
to use for students with simpler lab-based setups as well. It includes
advanced features such as higher-order modes, quantum noise and radiation
pressure effects. I used this tool to model aLIGO detector for the
Hackathon.\linebreak{}
\tabularnewline
\textcolor{cyan}{May 15 - July 15, 2019} & \textbf{\textcolor{blue}{Reducing the flexing of the arms of LISA
- a space based Gravitational Wave detector}}\textbf{}\linebreak{}
\textbf{\small{}Dr. Rajesh Nayak, IISER Kolkata}\linebreak{}
Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will be a spaced based gravitational
wave detector with an array of three spacecrafts in heliocentric orbit.
I developed a 3-body model to reduce the flexing in the arms of LISA
due to the breathing modes. This project helped me develop computational
skills, especially in using Python notebooks and theoretical concepts
like perturbation theory and celestial dynamics. The project ended
with me writing a Python code that could simulate the flexing in the
arms of LISA over its observing run.\linebreak{}
\tabularnewline
\textcolor{cyan}{Dec. 08 - Dec. 25, 2018} & \textbf{\textcolor{blue}{Deriving Geodesic equations for different
types of metrics}}\linebreak{}
\textbf{\small{}Dr. Naresh Dadhich, IUCAA Pune}\linebreak{}
A short reading project of “\textbf{Curved Space, curved Time,
and curved Space-Time in Schwarzschild geodetic geometry (\href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.03259}{arxiv:1812.03259})}.
I derived and calculated all the geodesic equations for different
types of metrics associated with Schwarzschild geometry, considering
space and time curvatures separately. The geodesic equations can then
be used to calculate the deflections due to 1 solar mass object and
it turned out to be exactly half of the “curved spacetime (1.75arcsec)”
in “curved space” and “curved time” metrics.\linebreak{}
\tabularnewline
\textcolor{cyan}{May 15 - July 15, 2018} & \textbf{\textcolor{blue}{Reading project in Cosmology, General Relativity
and Dark Matter}}\linebreak{}
\textbf{\small{}Dr. Subhadip Mitra, IIIT Hyderabad}\linebreak{}
A reading project in General Relativity, Cosmology and Dark Matter.
I studied General Relativity and Cosmology following textbooks by
Scott Dodelson, Bernard F. Schutz and James Hartle. This project helped
me gain the understanding of the basics of Tensor algebra and calculus,
General Relativity, Cosmology, and Dark Matter\linebreak{}
\tabularnewline
\textcolor{cyan}{May 20 - July 20, 2017} & \textbf{\textcolor{blue}{Quantum transport in mesoscopic system}}\linebreak{}
\textbf{\small{}Dr. Sourin Das, IISER Kolkata}\linebreak{}
I developed a Python code using Kwant module which could model topological
insulators in cubic and trapezoidal cubic geometry. This code was
used to simulate quantum hall effect in the mesoscopic systems by
attaching quantum gates to different sides of the cube, and measuring
the resistance offered by each side. \linebreak{}
